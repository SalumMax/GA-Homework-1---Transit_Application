Homework 1: A Transit Application
Step 1
Start with this data...

const stations = ["Museum", "St. James", "Circular Quay", "Wynyard", "Townhall", "Central", "Redfern", "Macdonaldtown", "Newtown"];
Create a function called travelFrom that receives a start station and an end station.

Print the number of stops between the two stations. (e.g. log out "To go from 'Circular Quay' to 'Central' - you'll need to go through 2 stops")
Print out the names of the stations on separate lines (e.g. log out "- Circular Quay", "- Wynyard", "- Townhall", "- Central")
Step 2
Make this work if you want to go backwards! e.g. 'You want to travel from "Redfern" to "St. James"'
Make it error-tolerant. E.g.:
Make it case-insensitive - there should be no difference between "redfern", "Redfern" and "REDFERN"
If someone passes in a station that doesn't exist, tell them
Bonus: A (more complicated) Transit Application
Make it work across lines! I'll leave it up to you to create the data you need - but create arrays of multiple train lines in Sydney, and try it to get to print out the same things as above - but also things like "Swap lines at ....."
This will be very, very difficult! Don't feel like you have to add in all the lines, just a few to prove that it is working
Look at the hints below
